## Color

HIG: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/

- Color should be semantic, not by appearance. For example, Label color is black in light mode, white in dark mode.
- Whenever possible, use system colors directly. These colors also have built in accessibility support for high-contrast, inverted color, ....
- Use sRGB color space for iOS devices, P3 color space for mac.
- iOS 13+, app support system light/dark mode.
- iOS 14+, app can specify an accent color.

## Dynamic Text and Spacing

### Dynamic Spacing

See [Dynamic Spacing Example](Examples/Dynamic%20Spacing%20Example.md)

### Dynamic Type

HIG: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/

- Specify style for font instead of point size.

## Images

- Use vector image for simple image: icons, no gradient or shadow.
- Vector image should use pdf format.

## Launch Screen

HIG: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/launch-screen

- Design a launch screen thatâ€™s nearly identical to the first screen of your app.

## Margin

HIG: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/

## Resource Variants

You can specify multiple versions for one resource under difference situation, these features requires **min** iOS 11+.

- Device: resource is different when app is running in different devices.
- Appearance: resource is different under light/dark mode.
- Direction: resource is different when using right-to-left language.
- Size Class: resource is different when app is running in different size class.
- Localization: resouce is different under different locale.

Here is a list of resources and supported types of varients:

- Color:
  - Deivce
  - Appearance
  - Localization
- Image:
  - Device

## SF Symbol

HIG: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/

## Size Class

HIG: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/

- UI should not be categorized by device type but by size classes.
- Be prepared for iPad slide over, iPad split view, iOS app on mac (mac catalyst or natively).
- [Size Class Varients](Examples/Size%20Class%20Varients.md)

## Case Study

- [Needed Measurement for One Cell](Examples/Needed%20Measurement%20for%20One%20Cell.md)

## Future Direction

- Containers: UISplitViewController, UINavigationController, UITabbarController
- SwiftUI?
